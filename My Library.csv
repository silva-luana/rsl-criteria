Although this problem is well-studied in news and social media, this problem has not received much attention in the life science domain. One outcome of tackling the EL problem in the life sciences domain is to enable scientists to build computational models of biological processes with more efficiency. However, simply applying a news-trained entity linker produces inadequate results. Since existing supervised approaches require a large amount of manually-labeled training data, which is currently unavailable for the life science domain, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured full texts of biomedical literature to 300 ontologies. The approach leverages the rich semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation and entity ranking. Without using any manual annotation, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EL method (9% absolute gain in linking accuracy). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art supervised EL method requires 15,000 manually annotated entity mentions for training. These promising results establish a benchmark for the EL task in the life science domain1. We also provide in depth analysis and discussion on both challenges and opportunities on automatic knowledge enrichment for scientific literature. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to address the EL problem in a new domain. We show that our unsupervised approach is able to outperform a current state-of-the-art supervised approach that has been trained with a large amount of manually labeled data. Life science presents an underrepresented domain for applying EL techniques. By providing a small benchmark data set and identifying opportunities, we hope to stimulate discussions across natural language processing and bioinformatics and motivate others to develop techniques for this largely untapped domain.",2014,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:35,3–4,,,,,,,DTMBIO '14,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Shanghai, China",,/home/luana/Zotero/storage/UCP3PEEJ/Zheng et al. - 2014 - Entity Linking for Biomedical Literature.pdf,,,biomedical literature; bological ontologies; entity linking; semantic web; signal transduction; text mining; wikification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such enrichment of existing hierarchical knowledge sources with new information to better model the ""changing world"" presents two-fold challenges: (1) Detection of previously unknown entities or concepts, and (2) Insertion of the new concepts into the knowledge structure, respecting the semantic integrity of the created relationships. To this end we propose a novel framework, ETF, to enrich large-scale, generic taxonomies with new concepts from resources such as news and research publications. Our approach learns a high-dimensional embedding for the existing concepts of the taxonomy, as well as for the new concepts. During the insertion of a new concept, this embedding is used to identify semantically similar neighborhoods within the existing taxonomy. The potential parent-child relationships linking the new concepts to the existing ones are then predicted using a set of semantic and graph features. Extensive evaluation of ETF on large, real-world taxonomies of Wikipedia and WordNet showcase more than 5% F1-score improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We further demonstrate that ETF can accurately categorize newly emerging concepts and question-answer pairs across different domains.",2018,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:39,745–754,,,,,,,SIGIR '18,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Ann Arbor, MI, USA",,/home/luana/Zotero/storage/NTX2VM42/Vedula et al. - 2018 - Enriching Taxonomies With Functional Domain Knowle.pdf,,,concept embedding; domain knowledge; semantic relationships; taxonomy enrichment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, methods and techniques to extract useful and relevant information from online repositories of research data have largely been based on static full text indexing which entails a 'produce once and use forever' kind of strategy. That strategy is fast becoming insufficient due to increasing data volume, concept obsolescence, and complexity and heterogeneity of content types in web repositories. We propose that by automatic semantic annotation of content in web repositories (using Linked Open Data or LoD sources) without using domain-specific ontologies, we can sustain the performance of searching by retrieving highly relevant search results. Secondly, we claim that by expert crowd-annotation of content on top of automatic semantic annotation, we can enrich the semantic index over time to augment the contextual value of content in web repositories so that they remain findable despite changes in language, terminology and scientific concepts. We deployed a custom-built annotation, indexing and searching environment in a web repository website that has been used by expert annotators to annotate webpages using free text and vocabulary terms. We present our findings based on the annotation and tagging data on top of LoD-based annotations and the overall modus operandi. We also analyze and demonstrate that by adding expert annotations to the existing semantic index, we can improve the relationship between query and documents using Cosine Similarity Measures (CSM).",2017,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:53,2019-06-15 17:45:43,53:1–53:12,,,,,,,ACSW '17,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,"event-place: Geelong, Australia",,/home/luana/Zotero/storage/Y5P4Z7NV/Khan et al. - 2017 - Crowd-annotation and LoD-based Semantic Indexing o.pdf,,,crowd-annotation; elasticsearch; linked open data; semantic annotations; semantic search; tagging and annotation; web repositories search,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
