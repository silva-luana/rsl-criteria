Lack of semantic information in the web services profiles poses a restriction in the automated discovery of services. Irrelevant and huge number of services returned by the UDDI and lack of standard mechanisms are the main problems faced by the users today during service discovery. In this paper, we propose a Web service discovery approach independent of the description model that tries to manage with the heterogeneity found in semantic service description frameworks. This proposed approach uses the principals from text mining, measures of semantic relatedness and information retrieval where the semantic information of the services is integrated with the syntactic service profiles to give hybrid service vectors. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach implemented on OWL-X services has been presented to show the feasibility of the approach.

The existing studies are mainly aiming at single concepts composed of single terms. For the compound concepts composed of multiple terms, they usually neglect the special constitution features of compounds and only process them as single concepts, which may affect the ultimate accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology-based Compound Concept Semantic Similarity calculation approach called CCSS which exploits concept constitution features. In CCSS, the compound is decomposed into Subject headings and Auxiliary words (SaA), and the relationships between these two sets are used to measure the similarity. Besides, the errors that may be caused by SaA recognition are corrected. Moreover, several information sources of ontology such as taxonomical features, local density and depth are considered.

Previous work on semantic similarity methods have focused on either the structure of the semantic network between concepts (e.g., path length and depth), or only on the Information Content (IC) of concepts. We propose a semantic similarity method, namely wpath, to combine these two approaches, using IC to weight the shortest path length between concepts. Conventional corpus-based IC is computed from the distributions of concepts over textual corpus, which is required to prepare a domain corpus containing annotated concepts and has high computational cost. As instances are already extracted from textual corpus and annotated by concepts in KGs, graph-based IC is proposed to compute IC based on the distributions of concepts over instances. Through experiments performed on well known word similarity datasets, we show that the wpath semantic similarity method has produced a statistically significant improvement over other semantic similarity methods. Moreover, in a real category classification evaluation, the wpath method has shown the best performance in terms of accuracy and F score.","2017-01","2019-06-15 15:02:59","2019-06-15 16:17:56","","72-85","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","semantic Web; Semantics; Integrated circuits; Taxonomy; knowledge based systems; Semantic similarity; WordNet; annotated concepts; computational cost; concept computing semantic similarity; concept distribution; concept IC; concept information content; corpus-based IC; DBpedia; graph theory; graph-based IC; information content; information networks; KG; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; knowledge graph; knowledge graphs; Measurement; Motion pictures; semantic network; semantic networks; semantic relatedness; textual corpus; word similarity datasets; wpath semantic similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The result is that the user of the web wasting much of his time to examine a large number of Web page by searching for what he needs, because the Web does not provide service in this direction. The Semantic Web is the solution; this new vision of the web is to make web resources not only understandable by humans but also by machines.

In this case, the descriptors are not directly chosen in the documents but in the ontology and are indexed by concepts that reflect their meaning rather than words are often ambiguous. To perform a search based on meaning, documents and their descriptors are stored in OWL ontologies describing the documentary features of a document.

The documents that are not of the given topic are said to be non-relevant. An IR engine may use the query to classify the documents in a collection, returning to the user a subset of documents that satisfy some classification criterion. There are several search engines to find information in the given repositories containing large amounts of unstructured form of text data. However, the task of ad hoc information retrieval is, finding documents within a corpus like Bible, that are relevant to the user remains a hard challenge. Sometimes the relevant documents may not contain the specified keyword. The lack of the given term in a document does not necessarily mean that the document is not a relevant.

It is time consuming and difficult to discover relevant datasets. Current open data catalogues provide mostly keyword-based search without the ability to understand the user's intent and the contextual meaning of the datasets. Ontology-based semantic search has been well explored in semantic web as an attempt to improve the quality of search for relevant documents and web pages. This paper applies semantic and machine learning technologies to open data. It presents an approach for search of open government datasets, a relatively underexplored domain, where the semantics of data relies on metadata that describes the data. The idea is to link the published datasets with concepts from a well-defined ontology and allow searching based on hybrid indexing. A simplified ontology for the transport domain is constructed to demonstrate and test the idea. A prototype search engine has been implemented which supports both manual and automatic linking to concepts in the ontology and exploits hybrid indexing based on these linking methods. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to dataset linking and indexing and enable the independency of the natural language used for describing the datasets. The manual linking of datasets to ontology concepts is intended for domain experts and data publishers, while the automatic linking is based on the provided dataset descriptions. The automatic linking reduces the overhead of manual concepts linking and the dependency on domain experts. Preliminary results have indicated that semantic search based on ontologies is a promising approach to increase search quality and efficiency for open data search. The success of the automatic mechanism does however depend on the quality and comprehensiveness of the dataset descriptions.","2019-01","2019-06-15 15:03:00","2019-06-15 16:28:08","","7-15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); semantic Web; document handling; search engines; Search engines; ontology; Web pages; Indexing; search engine; learning (artificial intelligence); natural language processing; natural language processing techniques; indexing; dataset indexing; dataset linking; Engines; government data processing; hybrid indexing; keyword-based search; machine learning technologies; meta data; ontology-based semantic search; open data search; open government data; Open government data; open government datasets; prototype search engine; Prototypes; public sector data; query formulation; relevant document search; semantic search; Semantic search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These methods are not only inefficient, but also wasted a lot of user's time to find a satisfactory results. In order to improve the problem above, we presented a different approach to identify user's request that attracts more interest is called a ontology-based and implied sentiment search. Ontology is a tree structure which represent specifications of concepts and relations among them. Ontology play a central role in semantic web applications by providing a shared knowledge about the objects in real world. This paper proposes a method for determining semantic similarity between concepts and implied sentiment defined in ontology. Unlike method exist that use ontological definition of concepts for similarity assessment, the presented approach also focuses on the relations between concepts and their implied sentiment inclination.

Now, the hybrid semantic similarity calculation method has been more popular. However, when the expert calculates the semantic similarity, weight values determined are based on expert's experience which has a certain degree of subjectivity and affect the accuracy and objectivity of the semantic similarity calculation. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved hybrid semantic similarity algorithm based on the fuzzy optimization methods.

A substantial amount of data on the Web is available in an unstructured format, such as Web pages, books, journals, and files. Acquiring appropriate information from such humongous data has become quite challenging and a time-consuming task. Trivial keyword-based information retrieval systems highly depend on the statistics of data, thus facing word mismatch problem due to inevitable semantic and context variations of a certain word. Therefore, this marks the desperate need to organize such massive data into a structured format so that information can be easily processed in a large context by taking data semantics into account. Ontologies are not only being extensively employed in the semantic Web to store unstructured information in an organized and structured way but it has also raised the performance of diverse information retrieval approaches to a great extent. Ontological information retrieval systems retrieve data based on the similarity of semantics between the user query and the indexed data.

Moreover, using current technology to discover proper semantic services for a composite service is time-consuming and inaccurate. To deal with these problems, we proposed a Web service similarities measurement method and a recommendation method. Based on ontology and information retrieval techniques, we compute among Web services. Then the similarities are used to classify services according to their topics, functionality and semantics. Our recommendation method is able to recommend proper component services to the composite service according to the history information of invocations and similar composite services.

However, research efforts have mainly focused on the semantic similarity of short texts. Document-level semantic measurement remains an open issue due to problems such as the omission of background knowledge and topic transition. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic matching method for long documents in the academic domain. To accurately represent the general meaning of an academic article, we construct a semantic profile in which key semantic elements such as the research purpose, methodology, and domain are included and enriched. As such, we can obtain the overall semantic similarity of two papers by computing the distance between their profiles. The distances between the concepts of two different semantic profiles are measured by word vectors. To improve the semantic representation quality of word vectors, we propose a joint word-embedding model for incorporating a domain-specific semantic relation constraint into the traditional context constraint. Our experimental results demonstrate that, in the measurement of document semantic similarity, our approach achieves substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods, and our joint word-embedding model produces significantly better word representations than traditional word-embedding models.","2017-12","2019-06-15 15:03:06","2019-06-15 16:19:18","","619-632","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; Semantics; information retrieval; data mining; text analysis; Knowledge based systems; natural language processing; Neural networks; word processing; pattern matching; Computational modeling; vectors; academic articles; computational linguistics; Context modeling; document semantic similarity; document-level semantic measurement; domain-specific semantic relation constraint; joint word-embedding model; long-document semantic measurement; scientific literature analysis; semantic elements; semantic enrichment; semantic matching method; semantic profile; semantic profiles; semantic representation quality; similarity measurement; Statistical analysis; text understanding; word embedding; word representations; word vectors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we purpose pruning method that improves accuracy by quickly filtering out the false alarms (whenever there is a change in the source) and automatically update the RDF document that can be further used for semantically retrieving the root source content of the particular resource.

The usefulness is appreciated by labeling the clusters with relevant words that describe their associated documents. The traditional approach for document clustering, i.e. bag-of-words representation, often ignores the semantic relations between terms. Hence, ontology-based document clustering is proposed. In the context of e-Learning, the richer annotation of learning materials, via the use of appropriate ontologies is a way to deal with the reusability and remix of learning objects. Through providing a semantic infrastructure that will explicitly declare the semantics and relations between concepts used in labeling learning objects, the desired quality in the learning offer can be ensured. This paper proposes an ontology-based document clustering approach based on two-step clustering algorithm and compares its performance with the conventional clustering. Ontology is introduced through defining a weighting scheme that integrates traditional scheme, i.e. co-occurrences of words, with weights of relations between words in ontology. Our experimental evaluations are performed on ICVL (International Conference on Virtual Learning) paper collection as dataset with e-Learning domain ontology as the background knowledge. The ontology was implemented by us through a different research. The results show that inclusion of ontology increases the clustering quality.","2016-04","2019-06-15 15:03:07","2019-06-15 16:13:49","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); Semantics; Electronic learning; pattern clustering; Natural language processing; Syntactics; Clustering algorithms; computer aided instruction; eLearning; Data mining; Document Clustering; e-Learning document clustering; e-Learning domain ontology; eLearning Concept; ICVL; international conference on virtual learning; labeling learning objects; Ontology Generation; Ontology-based Clustering; ontology-based document clustering; semantic infrastructure; semantic ontology-based document organizer; Semantic Relation; two-step clustering algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Computing the degree of semantic similarity between ontological concepts has been a significant function for their use in various applications. Semantic similarity measures that utilize the information content (IC) of an ontological concept have become more and more standard since they have been widely studied and evaluated. The meaning of information content and its calculation, however, have seen numerous interpretations and formulations. Just recently a method of calculating IC incorporates belief function and plausibility theory into the early corpus-based IC method. The argument is that humans intuitively use inductive inference, and, therefore, plausibility should be incorporated when calculating IC. Various approaches to determine IC measures and the role of the ontology structure has played in IC measures are reviewed. The recent inductive inference approach, which considers both the ontology structure and corpus frequency, is analyzed and compared to other existing IC measures. The analysis and comparison is motivated by the assumptions made in the construction of these IC measures and provides insights into factors to be considered in assessing the IC of an ontological concept.","2016-10","2019-06-15 15:03:07","2019-06-15 16:17:58","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); semantic similarity; semantic Web; Semantics; Integrated circuits; information content; inference mechanisms; Context; semantic similarity measures; belief function; belief maintenance; Biomedical measurement; corpus-based IC method; corpus-based information content; inductive inference approach; ontological concept; ontological similarity; ontology-based information content; plausibility theory; Proposals; Reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RDF datasets has proportionally more problems than relational datasets due to the way data are published, usually without formal criteria. Entity Resolution is n important issue which is related to a known task of many research communities and it aims at finding all representations that refer to the same entity in different datasets. Yet, it is still an open problem. Blocking methods are used to avoid the quadratic complexity of the brute force approach by clustering entities into blocks and limiting the evaluation of entity specifications to entity pairs within blocks. In the last years only a few blocking methods were conceived to deal with RDF data and novel blocking techniques are required for dealing with noisy and heterogeneous data in the Web of Data. In this paper we present a blocking scheme, CER-Blocking, which is based on an inverted index structure and that uses different data evidences from a triple, aiming to maximize its effectiveness. To overcome the problems of data quality or even the very absence thereof, we use two blocking key definitions. This scheme is part of an ER approach which is based on a relational learning algorithm that addresses the problem by statistical approximation.

Unlike most existing systems that perform document search based on keywords matching, we propose a search method that considers the meaning of the words in the query and the document. As a result, our algorithm can return documents that have no words in common with the input query as long as the documents are relevant. For example, a document that contains the words “Ford”, “Chrysler” and “General Motors” multiple times is surely relevant for the query “car” even if the word “car” does not appear in the document. Our semantic search algorithm is based on a similarity graph that contains the degree of semantic similarity between terms, where a term can be a word or a phrase. We experimentally validate our algorithm on the Cranfield benchmark that contains 1400 documents and 225 natural language queries. The benchmark also contains the relevant documents for every query as determined by human judgment.

Nonetheless, it already exhibits an interesting history and evolution. This book is a reflection on this evolution, aiming to take a snapshot of where we are at this specific point in time, and also showing what might be the focus of future research. This book provides both a conceptual and practical view of this evolution, especially targeted at readers who are starting research in this area and as support material for their supervisors. From a conceptual point of view, it highlights and discusses key questions that have animated the research community: what does it mean to be a Semantic Web system and how is it different from other types of systems, such as knowledge systems or web-based information systems? From a more practical point of view, the core of the book introduces a simple conceptual framework which characterizes Intelligent Semantic Web Systems. We describe this framework, the components it includes, and give pointers to some of the approaches and technologies that might be used to implement them. We also look in detail at concrete systems falling under the category of Intelligent Semantic Web Systems, according to the proposed framework, allowing us to compare them, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and identify the key fundamental challenges still open for researchers to tackle.","2016","2019-06-15 15:03:10","2019-06-15 17:18:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Morgan & Claypool","","","","","","","","","","","","","knowledge engineering; ontologies; semantic web; linked data; intelligent systems; knowledge-based systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Likewise due to the limited resources of mobile devices and the growing number of services, context awareness becomes a major requirement in social computing. Applications must be adapted to context constraints (such as the host's resources, the services properties and the surrounding environments) and must provide appropriate or personalized services. This paper presents features and architectural principles upon which is based the design and the development of our application for fostering spontaneous communities. This kind of communities answers the needs that cannot be solved in perennial communities or may be more effective in circumstantial situations (e.g. Accidents, natural disaster, crisis, fire, etc.). The application provides multiple services in order to satisfy the needs of users sharing a common interest or a common purpose.

In this paper, a new method based on user profile ontology built through ontology modularization is proposed. This latter, is composed of explicit and implicit user's preferences. The discovering of such preferences is achieved by a new method of content based ontology that aims to take into consideration both the hierarchical and the non-hierarchical (semantic) relations jointly with related properties. However, the extraction phase is gained by ontological rules SWRL which are extended through the Spreading activation technique in order to infer as much as possible new knowledge.

Because of the discrepancies that may appear during the modeling of ontologies, and due to the availability of ontologies covering overlapping domains, ontology evaluation is crucial in order to select the most appropriate ontology for a specific application. Many ontology evaluation mechanisms available in the literature assess the quality of ontologies according to their structural features. Even though, most of them propose ad-hoc scores aggregating different features, which lacks semantic and mathematical coherence. In this paper, we present an intuitive measure for ontology evaluation that quantifies the semantic dispersion of the ontology, which is both mathematically and semantically coherent. Our proposal is inspired in the standard notion of numerical dispersion of a sample and on a recent empirical study showing which ontological features can better predict the accuracy of ontologies. Our experiments, performed over a set of widely used ontologies, suggest that our measure positively correlates with such features, while offering a more coherent ontology evaluation score.","2014-11","2019-06-15 15:03:14","2019-06-15 16:13:44","","138-145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); Semantics; Taxonomy; knowledge based systems; knowledge-based systems; Standards; Accuracy; dispersion; Dispersion; Knowledge representation; Numerical models; ontological features; ontologies modelling; ontology evaluation; ontology semantic dispersion; semantic approach; semantics; structural features","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast amount of biological information about genes and proteins and their modulation by small molecules is pushing drug discovery to its next critical steps, involving the integration of chemical knowledge with these biological databases. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous datasets and the provision of algorithms to mine the integrated datasets would enable investigation of the complex mechanisms of drug action; however, traditional approaches face challenges in the representation and integration of multi-scale datasets, and in the discovery of underlying knowledge in the integrated datasets.

Semantic literature search is an approach to article retrieval and ranking using concepts rather than keywords, in an attempt to address the well-known deficiencies of keyword-based search, namely, (1) retrieval of an overwhelming number of results, (2) rankings that do not precisely reflect true relevance, and (3) the omission of relevant results because they do not contain the idiosyncratic keywords of the query. The difficulty of semantic search, however, is that it requires significant knowledge engineering, often in the form of conceptual ontologies tailored to a particular scientific domain. It also requires non-trivial tuning, in the form of domain-specific term and concepts weights. Here we present preliminary, work-in-progress results in the development of a semantic search system for the biogeochemical scientific literature. We report the following initial steps: first, one of the co-authors-a biogeochemistry expert-wrote a sample search query, and ranked the five most relevant articles that were returned for that query from a popular keyword-based search engine. We then hand annotated the five articles and the query with the Environmental Ontology (ENVO), an existing ontology for the domain. Critically, this pilot annotation revealed a number of missing concepts that we will add in future work. We then showed that a straightforward ontology distance metric between concepts in the search query and the five articles was sufficient to produce the expected ranking. We discuss the implications of these results, and outline next steps required produce a full-fledged semantic search system for the biogeochemistry scientific literature.","2017-08","2019-06-15 15:03:15","2019-06-15 17:18:44","","517-525","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","knowledge engineering; Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); information retrieval; search engines; Search engines; query processing; search engine; Natural language processing; Natural Language Processing; article retrieval; biochemistry; biogeochemical literature; biogeochemical scientific literature; biogeochemistry scientific literature; chemistry computing; conceptual ontologies; domain-specific term; Environmental Ontology; ENVO; expected ranking; Footwear; full-fledged semantic search system; geochemistry; geophysics computing; idiosyncratic keywords; nontrivial tuning; ontology distance metric; outline next steps; particular scientific domain; popular keyword; relevant articles; relevant results; research project; sample search query; search query; Sediments; semantic literature search; Semantic Search; work-in-progress results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Web search engines should be enriched with methodologies that enable it to understand the content of Web pages, then to align pages to the correct query category that highly match its content. In this paper, a proposed system is introduced to deal with the abundance of information by automatically understand the content of a Web page, and semantically model the ontological concepts that exist inside it. The semantic relations between ontological concepts are automatically given a score or weight based on its influence to the given query. The weighted semantic relations between ontological concepts can be viewed as a signature for the query, the highly similarity of an article to this signature, the more relevant to the query. A new relevancy measure is introduced to semantically re-rank or classify Web pages based on computing the semantic similarity of the weighted intersection ratio between ontological concepts extracted from retrieved Web pages, and ontological concepts that represents the query. Results shows that the proposed system has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (0.890) to human judgments which outperforms semantic similarity state-of-the-art methods and Web-based methods. The proposed model, was tested to re-rank Web pages according to the semantic relevancy of the query, experiments shows that it has the highest convergence to expert ranking order of Web pages compared to other Web search engines.","2015-08","2019-06-15 15:03:16","2019-06-15 16:18:28","","542-549","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); semantic similarity; Semantics; search engines; query processing; Web pages; information sources; learning (artificial intelligence); Web search engines; Internet; Electronic publishing; Encyclopedias; ontology learning; Semantic Search; information availability; ontological concepts; Ontology learning; Pearson correlation coefficient; query representation; relevancy measure; Search Engine ranking; Web page content understanding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, by exploring the WordNet lexical database and part-of-speech conversion through the established CatVar database that translates all non-noun words into their noun counterparts, and following the spirit of Lesk's disambiguation algorithm, a new disambiguation algorithm that maximizes the overall semantic similarity in the sense of Wu and Palmer measure between each sense of the target word and synsets of words of the context, is established. Second, motivated by the existence of WordNet domains for individual synsets, an overlapping based approach that quantifies the set intersection of synset domains, if not empty, or the hierarchy structure of the domains links through a simple path-length measure is put forward. Third, instead of exploring the whole set of words involved in the context, a selective approach that uses syntactic feature as outputted by Stanford Parser and a fixed length windowing is developed.

ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.","2016-02","2019-06-15 15:03:23","2019-06-15 17:18:48","","71-78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","semantic web; Semantics; information retrieval; Measurement; government data processing; meta data; Organizations; Metadata; data handling; metadata curation; metadata linking; metadata reconciliation approach; open data portal; open governamental data portal; portals; Portals; public data; semantic metadata layer; Standards organizations; tag; tag reconciliation; Tagging; tagging process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a framework that integrates heterogeneous knowledge from different resources (i.e. ontologies, texts, expert classifications) for capturing information about how a set of genes work together in targeting a biological process. Our approach grounds on the ontological annotation of gene summaries. Given the analogy between these annotations and the representation of documents in information retrieval, we apply techniques used in text mining to evaluate the semantic similarity of summaries within a gene set. To determine if our framework makes sense in a biological context, we conducted experiments on popular gene sets and compared results with what asserted by domain experts.

First, each link of an individual is weighted by applying DW. Then, a semantic similarity metric is proposed to combine the DW into similarity calculation. Then, a searching system framework for a similarity-based individual is designed and tested in real-world data sets. Finally, massive experiments are conducted both in benchmark and real-world social community data sets.

To bridge the semantic gap, a novel semantic tree-based SBR algorithm is proposed in this paper. Given a 2D sketch query and a collection of 3D models, a 3D semantic tree is built up first based on the ontology structure of WordNet. Every leaf node in the tree contains a set of 3D models assigned to this class according to their semantic classification/label information. Then, sketch components of the 2D query sketch are identified by sketch segmentation and annotation. Finally, by measuring the semantic relatedness between the sketch components' annotations and tree nodes in the 3D semantic tree, the similarities between the 2D sketch and 3D models are computed to find out the most relevant 3D models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and promising potentials of our approach on sketch-based 3D model retrieval.","2016-12","2019-06-15 15:03:26","2019-06-15 16:13:58","","3880-3885","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ontologies (artificial intelligence); Semantics; WordNet; Computational modeling; trees (mathematics); Solid modeling; 2D sketch query; 3D semantic tree; Benchmark testing; image classification; image representation; image retrieval; image segmentation; label information; leaf node; ontology structure; rough sketch representation; semantic classification; semantic tree-based approach; semantic tree-based SBR algorithm; Shape; sketch annotation; sketch component annotations; sketch segmentation; sketch-based 3D model retrieval; Three-dimensional displays; Two dimensional displays; user hand-drawn sketch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is often the case that relevant information is scattered over the Internet and/or maintained on disparate systems, buried in large amount of noisy data, and in heterogeneous formats, thereby complicating the access to reusable knowledge and extending the response time to reach a resolution.

Also, collaboratively built semi-structured information resources, such as Wikipedia, have become prevalent on the Web and can be inherently encoded in XML. Yet most methods for processing XML and semi-structured information handle mainly the syntactic properties of the data, while ignoring the semantics involved. To devise more intelligent applications, one needs to augment syntactic features with machine-readable semantic meaning. This can be achieved through the computational identification of the meaning of data in context, also known as (a.k.a.) automated semantic analysis and disambiguation, which is nowadays one of the main challenges at the core of the Semantic Web. This survey paper provides a concise and comprehensive review of the methods related to XML-based semi-structured semantic analysis and disambiguation. It is made of four logical parts. First, we briefly cover traditional word sense disambiguation methods for processing flat textual data. Second, we describe and categorize disambiguation techniques developed and extended to handle semi-structured and XML data.

Aiming at mapping between ontologies and reducing computation complexity, we provide a new approach based on Classification with Word and CONtext Similarity (CWCONS) to find equivalence relation between concepts. The basic idea of CWCONS is to classify the nodes of ontology trees into two types, the classification nodes and the concept nodes, both of which rely on the tree structure of an ontology.

The OpenFlow Management and Configuration Protocol (OF-CONFIG) is positioned as a solid candidate for the remote configuration of OpenFlow devices, but the fact that OF-CONFIG relies on NETCONF for its transport constrains its potential considerably. Indeed, the lack of comprehensive and standardized data models has hindered the utilization of NETCONF itself in traditional networks, and will likely confine OF-CONFIG to an elementary set of configurations until the expected data models arrive. In this paper, we present a semantic-based approach that eases and automates the configuration of network devices while complementing the capabilities of OF-CONFIG and NETCONF. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we have formalized the semantics of the switch/router configuration domain using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, we have developed an Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) system from the Command-Line Interface (CLI) of network devices. Third, we have defined a learning algorithm that enables automated interpretation of CLIs' configuration capabilities in heterogeneous (multi-vendor) network scenarios.

It is beneficial to many natural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and document summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in that they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two regions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion between its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web and ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation based on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for such tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation based on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method uses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text segments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to represent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured. The rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text in a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was evaluated on a wellknown dataset, and the results show that using ontological similarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed method by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the results show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.","2015-11","2019-06-15 15:03:28","2019-06-15 16:43:02","","1274-1283","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); semantic Web; Semantics; information retrieval; Information retrieval; text analysis; Measurement; pattern clustering; Natural language processing; Clustering algorithms; ontological similarity; similarity measure; document segmentation; document summarisation; HAC algorithm; Hidden Markov models; hierarchical agglomerative clustering; lexical cohesion; Lexical Cohesion; lexical similarity; natural language processing tasks; NLP tasks; Ontological similarity; ontology-based IR systems; OntoSeg; segmentation quality; text blocks; text representation; text segmentation; Text Segmentation; text subtopic structure; tree-like hierarchy; Vector Space Model; word-frequency metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Matching between query and document is not limited to search, and similar problems can be found in question answering, online advertising, cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, recommender systems, link prediction, image annotation, drug design, and other applications where one is faced with the general task of matching between objects from two different spaces. The technologies introduced in this monograph can be generalized into more general machine learning techniques, which are referred to as learning to match in this survey. It is hoped that the ideas and solutions explained in Semantic Matching in Search may motivate industrial practitioners to turn the research results into products. The methods introduced and the discussions around them should also stimulate academic researchers to find new research directions and approaches.","2014","2019-06-15 15:03:29","2019-06-15 16:43:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","now","","","","","","","","","","","","","Web search; Formal models and language models for IR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the study of relevance in information retrieval can now be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which explain how user behavior, document content, and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. Temporal Information Retrieval provides a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, centered on the following questions: what are temporal dynamics, why do they occur, and when and how to leverage temporal information throughout the search cycle and architecture. First, it explains the general and wide aspects associated with temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. Next, it pinpoints several research issues and the impact of such temporal characteristics on search; essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal query analysis, and time-aware ranking. It also addresses particular aspects of temporal information extraction; for instance, how to timestamp documents and generate temporal profiles of text. To this end, it presents existing temporal search engines and applications in related research areas, such as exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction, where the time dimension also plays an important role. In addition to providing an extensive overview of the topic, Temporal Information Retrieval is intended to be self-contained enough to be used as teaching material for researchers who want to get acquainted with the topic. It can be read and understood by anybody with basic information retrieval knowledge but is also an ideal reference for more advanced researchers who want a deeper understanding of this field of research.","2015","2019-06-15 15:03:29","2019-06-15 17:18:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","now","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Topic labeling, which aims to assign meaningful labels for discovered topics, has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we argue that the quality of topic labeling can be improved by considering ontology concepts rather than words alone, in contrast to previous works in this area, which usually represent topics via groups of words selected from topics. We have created: (1) a topic model that integrates ontological concepts with topic models in a single framework, where each topic and each concept are represented as a multinomial distribution over concepts and over words, respectively, and (2) a topic labeling method based on the ontological meaning of the concepts included in the discovered topics. In selecting the best topic labels, we rely on the semantic relatedness of the concepts and their ontological classifications. The results of our experiments conducted on two different data sets show that introducing concepts as additional, richer features between topics and words and describing topics in terms of concepts offers an effective method for generating meaningful labels for the discovered topics.","2015-12","2019-06-15 15:03:29","2019-06-15 16:17:37","","259-264","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); Semantics; text analysis; Knowledge based systems; semantic relatedness; Computer science; Vocabulary; Computational modeling; automatic topic labeling; DBpedia ontology; Labeling; latent topic; multinomial distribution; ontological classification; ontology-based topic model; statistical distributions; Statistical learning; text corpora; topic model labeling; topic modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, heterogeneity exists in different sensors which makes some service operators of Internet of Thing (IoT) difficult (such as such as semantic inferring, non-linear inverted index establishing, service composing). There is a great deal of research about sensor ontology alignment dealing with the heterogeneity between the different sensor ontologies, but fewer solutions focus on exploiting syntaxes in a sensor ontology and the pattern of accessing alignments. Our solution infers alignments by extending structural subsumption algorithms to analyze syntaxes in a sensor ontology, and then combines the alignments with the SKOS model to construct the integration sensor ontology, which can be accessed via the IoT. The experiments show that the integration senor ontology in the SKOS model can be utilized via the IoT service, and the accuracy of our prototype, in average, is higher than others over the four real ontologies.","2017","2019-06-15 15:03:30","2019-06-15 16:15:35","","137-155","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); Semantics; SKOS; Cognition; Sensors; Data models; Analytical models; data models; Inference algorithms; Internet of Things; IoT; IOT; semantic sensor; semantic sensors data; sensor ontology alignment; SKOS data model; structural subsumption algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the matching problem, a description logic based matching technique is proposed. The description logic consists of TBox and ABox to separate the individual and universally quantified properties. The user input can be matched against ontology database and allows us to formalize information of domain as classes and instances. The DL-structured data format is processed through Hadoop to obtain the optimal matching service platform. The unstructured information is stored as files in the Hadoop Distributed File System and MapReduce operation is performed for simplified development of programs. The SPARQL query is used for querying data stored in Mongodb. Mongodb has collection of RDF datasets and are processed for matching using SPARQL query. The resultant dataset for the user input is given in the form of text document. The performance of the matching system is improved in terms of query response time and iteration time. Comparing with the existing system proves that the proposed system provide an optimal solution with minimal search time and maximum accuracy.","2015-05","2019-06-15 15:03:30","2019-06-15 16:17:32","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; ontologies (artificial intelligence); OWL; Semantics; Resource description framework; Databases; query processing; ontology matching; World Wide Web; information extraction; parallel processing; RDF datasets; information retrieval system; data handling; description logic; ABox; data querying; Database languages; DL-structured data format; hadoop; Hadoop distributed file system; iteration time; iterative methods; mongodb; Mongodb; ontology database; optimal matching service platform; query performance analysis; query response time; search time; service matching; SPARQL query; SPARQL query language; TBox; text document; Time factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The expert system uses different modules: Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis, categorization, semantic disambiguation, Automatic Query Expansion (AQE), semantic search, summarization, knowledge extraction, and aggregation. Users can interact with the expert system in different ways, varying from giving very specific orders to writing a simple list of keywords.

However, creativity of ideas has only been studied in sporadic attempts, and most of them only share little similarity in conditions. Moreover, since knowledge is the basis of all kinds of idea generation, knowledge reuse is very valuable in order to enhance the generation process and the results' quality including creativity. Besides the idea generation methods and techniques have recently been developed in our earlier work, this study focuses on the reuse of the knowledge bases for ontology construction. It aims to enhance the effectiveness and innovation of generated research ideas. Specifically, this paper presents an ideas creation framework with knowledge reuse process as a creative computing. In particular, ontologies merging techniques with supporting algorithms are proposed and designed.

Similarly, we all have experienced the frustration of searching the Web for papers and other information, and getting useless or unsatisfactory results.

Indeed, there is fervid activity around this goal, and some interesting achievements have begun to appear in terms of search effectiveness and navigation satisfaction. Novel formats for representing scientific-paper contents are proposed, enhancing machine processing capability. However, embracing the new information technology proposals requires a cultural change from authors and from editors, and we cannot take it for granted that it will happen in the near future. Moreover, already-published papers should not be left out from approaching Web innovations. In this paper, we therefore focus both on the emerging technologies for generating more searchable files, and on those technologies allowing the transformation of existing PDF files into more-effective formats. These technologies need to be customized to each specific domain, thus rendering the codification of specific electromagnetic (EM) concepts of paramount importance.

A wide range of courses are offered by the individual universities whose delivery mode and entry requirements differ. A personalized recommendation system can be an effective way of suggesting the relevant courses to the prospective students. This paper introduces a novel approach that personalizes course recommendations that will match the individual needs of users. The proposed approach developed a framework of an ontology-based hybrid-filtering system called the ontology-based personalized course recommendation (OPCR). This approach aims to integrate the information from multiple sources based on the hierarchical ontology similarity with a view to enhancing the efficiency and the user satisfaction and to provide students with appropriate recommendations. The OPCR combines collaborative-based filtering with content-based filtering. It also considers familiar related concepts that are evident in the profiles of both the student and the course, determining the similarity between them. Furthermore, OPCR uses an ontology mapping technique, recommending jobs that will be available following the completion of each course. This method can enable students to gain a comprehensive knowledge of courses based on their relevance, using dynamic ontology mapping to link the course profiles and student profiles with job profiles. Results show that a filtering algorithm that uses hierarchically related concepts produces better outcomes compared to a filtering method that considers only keyword similarity. In addition, the quality of the recommendations is improved when the ontology similarity between the items’ and the users’ profiles were utilized. This approach, using a dynamic ontology mapping, is flexible and can be adapted to different domains. The proposed framework can be used to filter the items for both postgraduate courses and items from other domains.","2019","2019-06-15 15:03:33","2019-06-15 16:28:07","","5180-5199","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontologies; Semantics; ontology; Data mining; Education; course recommender system; education domain; Engineering profession; Information overload; recommendation systems; Recommender systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various types of web information are present in our daily lives, and spatial content can facilitate the understanding of that information. Hence, many studies have been conducted to extract the implicit spatial location from different web resources, and they have mainly investigated web textual information. However, the existing studies mainly focus on the extraction or simple presentation of the location of the information, while further exploration and visualization of the information through the comprehensive consideration of its spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions have rarely been performed. Thus, this paper proposes a novel modeling and visualization framework for location-referenced web textual information. The framework applies an information model to structurally extract and resolve spatial content along with the temporal and semantic elements from the location-referenced information items. Based on the constructed information model, the information items are hierarchically clustered and visualized by combining map mashups with cartographic processes and methods. This framework enables users to interactively index and browses individual information items. Furthermore, the association relationships involved in the information set are explored in our work.

This is motivated by the increasing engineering efforts of manufacturing systems due to changing requirements, varying product variants and also malfunctions. In context of the method plug and produce physical adaptability, the customization of the plant layout of a production system, is an integral part. Physical adaptions become necessary when e.g. the production process is changed, the process performance requires to be optimized or manufacturing components need to be replaced. Consequently, a technique for determining appropriate manufacturing modules for a given production process is needed. In contrast to current methods this paper presents a novel approach for physical adaptability especially respecting the discrete system behavior of manufacturing modules. For this purpose, subgraph isomorphism is combined with a semantic matching filter together with additional matching criteria. Both, matching filter and matching criteria are tailored to the use case of plug and produce. Based on a case-study the proposed method is evaluated.

The architecture consists of profile agent and library recommender agent. The main task of Library recommender agent is filtering and providing recommendations. Library resources include book records having table of contents, journal articles including abstract, keywords. Rich set of keywords are obtained to compute similarity via table of contents and abstracts. The library resources are classified into fourteen categories specified in ACM computing classification system 2012 (ACM CCS). The identified category provides a way to obtain semantically related keywords for the library resources.

Enabling complex analytics, however, requires entities in KGs to be represented in a way that is suitable for Machine Learning tasks. Several approaches have been recently proposed for obtaining vector representations of KGs based on identifying and extracting relevant graph substructures using uniform and biased random walks. However, such approaches lead to representations comprising mostly ""popular"" instead of ""relevant"" entities in the KG. In KGs, in which different types of entities often exist (such as in Linked Open Data), a given target entity may have its own distinct set of most ""relevant"" nodes and edges. We propose specificity as an accurate measure of identifying most relevant, entity-specific, nodes and edges. We develop a scalable method based on bidirectional random walks to compute specificity. Our experimental evaluation results show that specificity-based biased random walks extract more ""meaningful"" (in terms of size and relevance) substructures compared to the state-of-the-art and the graph embedding learned from the extracted substructures outperform existing techniques in the chosen task of entity recommendation.","2018-07","2019-06-15 15:03:36","2019-06-15 16:18:29","","378-385","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantics; information retrieval; Resource description framework; knowledge based systems; Semantic Web; graph theory; knowledge graphs; Measurement; Task analysis; Feature extraction; RDF; random processes; Films; bidirectional random walks; data analytics tasks; entity recommendation; entity-specific substructures extraction; Graph Embedding; graph substructures; KG vector representations; Knowledge Graphs; Linked Open Data; machine learning tasks; Object recognition; RDF graph embedding; specificity-based biased random walks; structured data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To monitor semantic drifts within the observation period, an experiment was carried out on the term space of a collection of 12.8 million Amazon book reviews. For evaluation, the semantic consistency of ESOM term clusters was compared with their respective neighbourhoods in WordNet, and contrasted with distances among term vectors by random indexing. We found that at 0.05 level of significance, the terms in the clusters showed a high level of semantic consistency. Tracking the drift of distributional patterns in the term space across time periods, we found that consistency decreased, but not at a statistically significant level.

Discovering relevant services as the constituents of composite services is a crucial task, which needs to be frequently performed during the composition process. Due to the fact that the amount of services available on the Internet is increasing drastically, the efficiency of both service discovery and composition becomes a big challenge. To solve this challenge, we propose a Priori Knowledge Based Service Composition (PKBSC) approach to reduce the searching space of relevant service discovery so as to improve the efficiency of service composition. PKBSC utilizes an interoperable approach, including an ontology construction and merging method, to solve the problem of the cross-domain and heterogeneous services from different repositories. In addition,service patternis adopted to describe priori knowledge from massive historical solutions, which is a recurrent valuable fragment composed of services frequently invoked together in service solutions. PKBSC also adopts the Formal Concept Analysis to extract the implicit relationship between service requests and service patterns. Compared with the approach of composing multiple services from scratch, PKBSC exhibits better performance since the search space is greatly reduced by the adoption of service patterns. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency of service composition by 22.44%.","2018","2019-06-15 15:03:40","2019-06-15 17:18:22","","68263-68276","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Formal concept analysis; frequent pattern mining; Ontologies; Semantic Web; Semantics; service composition; service pattern; Task analysis; Web services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This scheme involves expanding the terms of Web API/service documents based on DBpedia and WordNet. Unsuitable APIs/services are then filtered out using a four-step process, as follows: 1) calculation of semantic similarity between a set of candidate APIs/services and a user query, 2) analysis of interface compatibility between candidate APIs/services using the Hungarian Algorithm, 3) invocation of candidate APIs/services to verify functionality and availability, and 4) analysis of similarity between the actual response of the candidate services and the expected response specified in the user query.

Our results show that our method successfully measures similarity among higher education institutions syllabi and can be generalized to most Ecuadorian institutions.","2018-11","2019-06-15 15:03:44","2019-06-15 16:14:09","","261-268","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","application program interfaces; automatic system; cosine similarity; course contents; data mining; Ecuadorian institutions; education; Education; educational administrative data processing; educational courses; educational institutions; Electronic publishing; Encyclopedias; further education; Google Engine; higher education institutions syllabi; Internet; latent semantic analysis; pre-processing techniques; Semantics; students; students' mobility.; Support Vector Machine; support vector machines; syllabi contents semantic comparison; syllabi similarities; syllabus similarity; text analysis; text enrichment; text mining; Text mining; text mining methodology; Text similarity; text similarity methods; Web sites; Wikipedia API","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current text knowledge representation models either lose much knowledge [e.g., vector space model (VSM)] or have a high complex computation [e.g., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)]; even some of them cannot be constructed automatically [e.g., web ontology language, (OWL)]. In this paper, a novel text knowledge representation model, power series representation (PSR) model, which has a low complex computation in text knowledge constructing process, is proposed to leverage the contradiction between carrying rich knowledge and automatic construction. First, concept algebra of human concept learning is developed to represent text knowledge as the form of power series. Then, degree-2 power series hypothesis is introduced to simplify the proposed PSR model, which can be automatically constructed with a lower complex computation and has more knowledge than the VSM and LDA. After that, degree-2 power series hypothesis-based reasoning operations are developed, which provide a more flexible reasoning ability than OWL and LDA. Furthermore, experiments and comparisons with current knowledge representation models show that our model has better characteristics than others when representing text knowledge. Finally, a demo is given to indicate that PSR model has a good prospect over the area of web semantic search.","2014-01","2019-06-15 15:03:44","2019-06-15 16:43:06","","86-102","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","algebra; Association rules; Cognition; Cognitive informatics; computational complexity; Computational modeling; concept algebra; degree-2 power series hypothesis-based reasoning operations; human concept learning; inference mechanisms; knowledge representation; Knowledge representation; learning (artificial intelligence); Linearity; low complex computation; OWL; power series representation model; PSR model; reasoning ability; reasoning-based knowledge services; semantic search; series (mathematics); text analysis; text knowledge constructing process; text knowledge representation model; text understanding; Web resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most common techniques used for the particular category of people (is e-learning, which is the best option for those people. They have some difficulties such as, learning, communication, understanding, etc. for providing a better learning environment; many existing e-learning mechanisms provide the recommendation of subjects based on their personalization. However, it makes the whole learning process as complex, and there is a need to collect the request from them, which are the major drawbacks of the existing scheme. To overcome the issues, a new type of web-based e-learning system, namely, Most Similar Most Frequent Recommendation (MSMFR) is proposed in this paper with query analyzing option for people, who using e-learning. The proposed system is entirely based on the data structures such as stack, queue, linked list, etc in the distributed environment. Here, the physically challenged people can able to share their recommended content to others, who search the same one. Moreover, we provide a secure access and provisioning for them. The primary intention of this paper is to improve the learning capability of physically challenged people. Initially, the required information is collected from the data owner and, the meta-data is created from that data. Then, the query is obtained from the user, which is parsed into attributes. Hence, the semantic relationship between the attributes and meta-data and the visiting frequency are found out. Here, the rating ratio is calculated for the requested query by using a web history. Finally, the required information such as web or video is retrieved. This application is implemented in real-time and the results obtained are illustrated in the experimental section.","2017-01","2019-06-15 15:03:45","2019-06-15 16:13:40","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","computer aided instruction; data structures; Data Structures; E-Learning; e-learning mechanisms; educational environment; Electronic learning; Information Retrieval; Internet; learning environment; learning process; Mathematical model; metadata; Most Similar Most Frequent Recommendation; Most Similar Most Frequent Recommendation (MSMFR); MSMFR; Multimedia communication; personalization; physically challenged people; Query Analyzing; real-time application; Relevancy; Semantics; similarity measurement; Time and Visiting Frequency; visiting frequency; Web history; Web pages; Web-based e-learning system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This growth combined with the proliferation of natural language systems for search and retrieving information provides tremendous opportunities for studying some of the areas where database systems and natural language processing systems overlap. This book explores two interrelated and important areas of overlap: (1) managing natural language data and (2) developing natural language interfaces to databases. It presents relevant concepts and research questions, state-of-the-art methods, related systems, and research opportunities and challenges covering both areas. Relevant topics discussed on natural language data management include data models, data sources, queries, storage and indexing, and transforming natural language text. Under natural language interfaces, it presents the anatomy of these interfaces to databases, the challenges related to query understanding and query translation, and relevant aspects of user interactions. Each of the challenges is covered in a systematic way: first starting with a quick overview of the topics, followed by a comprehensive view of recent techniques that have been proposed to address the challenge along with illustrative examples. It also reviews some notable systems in details in terms of how they address different challenges and their contributions. Finally, it discusses open challenges and opportunities for natural language management and interfaces. The goal of this book is to provide an introduction to the methods, problems, and solutions that are used in managing natural language data and building natural language interfaces to databases.

Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) provide a key to disclosing the potential of Open Government data, by supplying common terms for marking up metadata and data in a consistent and coherent way. However, quality information is needed to help public institutions decide whether to adopt an existing or newly created CV. The paper discusses how to evaluate and document CV quality thus facilitating a comparison of different controlled vocabularies based on contextual information. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to assess the overall quality and rank of a controlled vocabulary, by integrating various quality dimensions according to the decision maker's needs. A set of e-Government controlled vocabularies that facilitate the semantic interoperability of e-Government data are selected as a testbed, and updated quality values are made available as Linked Data. Multi-step guidelines are also defined promoting and complementing the adoption of W3C recommendations to provide machine-readable quality metadata. This fosters reliability and re-usability by providing consumers with information on the assessment process carried out and the outcomes achieved. We illustrate the application of these guidelines by focusing on provenance and quality documentation.","2019","2019-06-15 15:03:50","2019-06-15 16:18:07","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Analytic Hierarchy Process; context; Controlled vocabularies; Data integrity; data quality; Electronic government; Measurement; metadata; Metadata; Quality assessment; Vocabulary; workflow provenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the connection to linguistics, argumentation has for a long time been a topic in Artificial Intelligence, where the focus is on devising adequate representations and reasoning formalisms that capture the properties of argumentative exchange. It is generally very difficult to connect the two realms of reasoning and text analysis, but we are convinced that it should be attempted in the long term, and therefore we also touch upon some fundamentals of reasoning approaches. Then the book turns to its focus, the computational side of mining argumentation in text. We first introduce a number of annotated corpora that have been used in the research. From the NLP perspective, argumentation mining shares subtasks with research fields such as subjectivity and sentiment analysis, semantic relation extraction, and discourse parsing. Therefore, many technical approaches are being borrowed from those (and other) fields. We break argumentation mining into a series of subtasks, starting with the preparatory steps of classifying text as argumentative (or not) and segmenting it into elementary units. Then, central steps are the automatic identification of claims, and finding statements that support or oppose the claim. For certain applications, it is also of interest to compute a full structure of an argumentative constellation of statements. Next, we discuss a few steps that try to 'dig deeper': to infer the underlying reasoning pattern for a textual argument, to reconstruct unstated premises (so-called 'enthymemes'), and to evaluate the quality of the argumentation. We also take a brief look at 'the other side' of mining, i.e., the generation or synthesis of argumentative text. The book finishes with a summary of the argumentation mining tasks, a sketch of potential applications, and a–necessarily subjective–outlook for the field.","2018","2019-06-15 15:03:51","2019-06-15 16:17:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","Morgan & Claypool","","","","","","","","","","","","","argument models; argumentation mining; argumentative language; claim detection; enthymemes; evidence detection; natural language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It characterizes a wide range of both expert-based and collaboratively constructed lexical knowledge bases. Only basic familiarity with NLP is required and this book has been written for both students and researchers in NLP and related fields who are interested in knowledge-based approaches to language analysis and their applications. Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs) are indispensable in many areas of natural language processing, as they encode human knowledge of language in machine readable form, and as such, they are required as a reference when machines attempt to interpret natural language in accordance with human perception. In recent years, numerous research efforts have led to the insight that to make the best use of available knowledge, the orchestrated exploitation of different LKBs is necessary. This allows us to not only extend the range of covered words and senses, but also gives us the opportunity to obtain a richer knowledge representation when a particular meaning of a word is covered in more than one resource. Examples where such an orchestrated usage of LKBs proved beneficial include word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, semantic parsing, and text classification. This book presents different kinds of automatic, manual, and collaborative linkings between LKBs. A special chapter is devoted to the linking algorithms employing text-based, graph-based, and joint modeling methods. Following this, it presents a set of higher-level NLP tasks and algorithms, effectively utilizing the knowledge in LLKBs. Among them, you will find advanced methods, e.g., distant supervision, or continuous vector space models of knowledge bases (KB), that have become widely used at the time of this book's writing. Finally, multilingual applications of LLKB's, such as cross-lingual semantic relatedness and computer-aided translation are discussed, as well as tools and interfaces for exploring LLKBs, followed by conclusions and future research directions.","2016","2019-06-15 15:03:53","2019-06-15 16:19:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","Morgan & Claypool","","","","","","","","","","","","","automatic knowledge base construction; continuous vector space models; distant supervision; graph-based methods; lexical knowledge bases; linked lexical knowledge bases; multilingual applications; sense alignment; text similarity; word sense disambiguation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this book, we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining structures of factual knowledge (e.g., entities and their relationships) from massive, unstructured text corpora. Departing from many existing structure extraction methods that have heavy reliance on human annotated data for model training, our effort-light approach leverages human-curated facts stored in external knowledge bases as distant supervision and exploits rich data redundancy in large text corpora for context understanding. This effort-light mining approach leads to a series of new principles and powerful methodologies for structuring text corpora, including (1) entity recognition, typing and synonym discovery, (2) entity relation extraction, and (3) open-domain attribute-value mining and information extraction.

Dengue outbreaks are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, mainly in urban and sub-urban areas. The outbreak is one of the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, dengue infection has increased 30-fold globally over the past five decades. About 50-100 million new infections occur annually in more than 80 countries. Many researchers are working on measures to prevent and control the spread. One avenue of research is collaboration between computer science and the epidemiology researchers in developing methods of predicting potential outbreaks of dengue infection. An important research objective is to develop models that enable, or enhance, forecasting of outbreaks of dengue, giving medical professionals the opportunity to develop plans for handling the outbreak, well in advance. Researchers have been gathering and analyzing data to better identify the relational factors driving the spread of the disease, as well as the development of a variety of methods of predictive modeling using statistical and mathematical analysis and machine learning. In this substantial review of the literature on the state of the art of research over the past decades, we identified six main issues to be explored and analyzed: 1) the available data sources; 2) data preparation techniques; 3) data representations; 4) forecasting models and methods; 5) dengue forecasting models evaluation approaches; and 6) future challenges and possibilities in forecasting modeling of dengue outbreaks.

A physical object is the fundamental building block of the IoT, known as aSmart Device, that can monitor the environment. These devices can communicate with each other and have data processing abilities. When deployed, smart devices collect real-time data and publish the gathered data on the Web. The functionality of smart devices can be abstracted as aserviceand an IoT application can be built by combining the smart devices with these services that help to address challenges of day-to-day activities. The IoT comprises billions of these intelligent communicating devices that generate enormous amount of data, and hence performing analysis on this data is a significant task. Using search techniques, the size and extent of data can be reduced and limited, so that an application can choose just the most important and valuable data items as per its necessities. It is, however, a tedious task to effectively seek and select a proper device and/or its data among a large number of available devices for a specific application. Search techniques are fundamental to IoT and poses various challenges like a large number of devices, dynamic availability, restrictions on resource utilization, real time data in various types and formats, past and historical monitoring. In the recent past, various methods and techniques have been developed by the research community to address these issues. In this paper, we present a review of the state-of-the-art search methods for the IoT, classifying them according to their design principle and search approaches as: IoT data and IoT object-based techniques. Under each classification, we describe the method adopted, their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we identify and discuss key challenges and future research directions that will allow the next generation search techniques to recognize and respond to user queries and satisfy the information needs of users.","2018","2019-06-15 15:03:56","2019-06-15 16:43:31","","2101-2132","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Electronic mail; Internet of Things; Middleware; Monitoring; ranking and indexing; Real-time systems; resource discovery; search and selection; search challenges; Search problems; search requirements; service discovery; Smart devices; Tutorials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study an important information leakage problem caused by unplanned data distribution in multicloud storage services. Then, we present StoreSim, an information leakage aware storage system in multicloud. StoreSim aims to store syntactically similar data on the same cloud, thus minimizing the user's information leakage across multiple clouds. We design an approximate algorithm to efficiently generate similarity-preserving signatures for data chunks based on MinHash and Bloom filter, and also design a function to compute the information leakage based on these signatures. Next, we present an effective storage plan generation algorithm based on clustering for distributing data chunks with minimal information leakage across multiple clouds. Finally, we evaluate our scheme using two real datasets from Wikipedia and GitHub. We show that our scheme can reduce the information leakage by up to 60% compared to unplanned placement.

In many emerging applications, people's information need from text data is becoming multidimensional—they demand useful insights along multiple aspects from a text corpus. However, acquiring such multidimensional knowledge from massive text data remains a challenging task. This book presents data mining techniques that turn unstructured text data into multidimensional knowledge. We investigate two core questions. (1) How does one identify task-relevant text data with declarative queries in multiple dimensions? (2) How does one distill knowledge from text data in a multidimensional space? To address the above questions, we develop a text cube framework. First, we develop a cube construction module that organizes unstructured data into a cube structure, by discovering latent multidimensional and multi-granular structure from the unstructured text corpus and allocating documents into the structure. Second, we develop a cube exploitation module that models multiple dimensions in the cube space, thereby distilling from user-selected data multidimensional knowledge. Together, these two modules constitute an integrated pipeline: leveraging the cube structure, users can perform multidimensional, multigranular data selection with declarative queries; and with cube exploitation algorithms, users can extract multidimensional patterns from the selected data for decision making. The proposed framework has two distinctive advantages when turning text data into multidimensional knowledge: flexibility and label-efficiency. First, it enables acquiring multidimensional knowledge flexibly, as the cube structure allows users to easily identify task-relevant data along multiple dimensions at varied granularities and further distill multidimensional knowledge. Second, the algorithms for cube construction and exploitation require little supervision; this makes the framework appealing for many applications where labeled data are expensive to obtain.","2019","2019-06-15 15:03:57","2019-06-15 16:19:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Morgan & Claypool","","","","","","","","","","","","","data cube; limited supervision; multidimensional analysis; text mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose Sigmoid similarity, a feature-based semantic similarity measure on instances in a specific ontology, as an improvement of Dice measure. We performed two separate evaluations with real evaluators. The first evaluation includes 137 subjects and 25 pairs of concepts in the recipes domain and the second one includes 147 subjects and 30 pairs of concepts in the drinks domain. To the best of our knowledge these are some of the most extensive evaluations in the field.

This paper proposes a new semantic Web Service discovery scheme where the similarity between the query and service is decided using the WSDL specification and ontology, and the improved Hungarian algorithm is applied to quickly find the maximum match. The proposed approach utilizes the structure of datatype and operation, and natural language description used for information retrieval. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed scheme substantially increases the quality of service discovery compared to the existing schemes in terms of precision, recall rate, and F-measure. Moreover, the proposed scheme allows consistently smaller discovery time, while the improvement gets more significant as the number of compared parameters increases.","2016","2019-06-15 15:23:50","2019-06-15 16:15:30","","153-176","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hindi wordnet, which forms the foundation for other Indian language wordnets, has been linked to the English WordNet. To maximize linkages, an important strategy of using direct and hypernymy linkages has been followed. However, the hypernymy linkages were found to be inadequate in certain cases and posed a challenge due to sense granularity of language. Thus, the idea of creating bilingual mappings was adopted as a solution. A bilingual mapping means a linkage between a concept in two different languages, with the help of translation and/or transliteration. Such mappings retain meaningful representations, while capturing semantic similarity at the same time. This has also proven to be a great enhancement of Hindi wordnet and can be a crucial resource for multilingual applications in natural language processing, including machine translation and cross language information retrieval.","2016","2019-06-15 15:23:50","2019-06-15 16:19:15","","406-413","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since geospatial information is generated and made available over the Internet by different stakeholders, heterogeneity of geospatial data and geospatial data sources becomes inevitable. This heterogeneity of globally available geospatial data sources introduces great challenges for individuals who are trying to discover and assemble geospatial data from distributed geospatial data sources. From the standpoint of individuals who do not belong to Geo-Information System (GIS) realm but belong to a group of geoportal users group, the process of discovering and accessing heterogeneous geospatial data has proven to be a difficult one to govern. Since geoportals are foreseen as single points of discovery and access to geo-information, geoportal users expect geoportal to provide them with a mechanism to easily find (discover) what they are searching for, using their own language. Such mechanism would significantly improve the usability of a geoportal and user satisfaction. The implementation of such mechanism highly depends on the infrastructure a geoportal relies on - an interoperable geo-information dissemination environment. To enhance discoverability of geospatial data and lay the knowledge foundation that can be used for geoportal usability improvement, scientists and engineers have developed interoperable geoinformation dissemination environments based on the following approaches: syntactic standardization and semantic annotation of Web-accessible geo-information sources, and ontology-driven geoinformation integration. Despite these approaches enhance discovery of heterogeneous and distributed geospatial data sources, there are still some issues which should be addressed to make geospatial data sources fully discoverable. As an example, in most cases geoportal users are not provided with an explicit description of the meaning of geospatial resources or may not know what keywords they should use to discover appropriate geo-information. Given these challenges, we have defined a novel methodology used for geoportal usability improvement. Our methodology is foreseen to be used within geoportals relying on ontology-driven geo-information integration architectures. An approach implemented within this methodology utilizes terms extracted from a natural language description of geo-information, defined by the end users. User-defined description is disambiguated through means of a combination of unsupervised word sense disambiguation methods. Once disambiguated, this description is matched with the sense of the (domain/local) ontology concept names. The matching process is performed through semantic similarity measurement between disambiguated user-defined description and the sense of the (domain/local) ontology concepts. Our methodology simplifies geospatial data discovery and can be easily implemented because it uses ontological components of the underlying architectures in their original form. The methodology we describe in this paper will be discussed in the context of similar prominent solutions. Also, this paper will present a prototype which will demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The implemented prototype is a stand-alone desktop application, which uses two resources as input: userdefined geo-information description and (domain/local) ontologies developed using Web Ontology Language (OWL). We will provide an overview of benefits over approaches that have been previously used for geospatial data discovery and offer guidelines for future improvement and development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2015","2019-06-15 15:23:51","2019-06-15 16:19:19","","1-15","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, optimizing the query processing to produce the most relevant results with only minimum computations is a challenging research issue. Current proposals suffer from several drawbacks, e.g., limited scalability, tight coupling with the existing ontology, and too many computations. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach to keyword search with automatic depth decisions using the relational and semantic similarities. Our approach uses a predicate that represents the semantic relationship between the subject and object. We take advantage of this to narrow down the target RDF data. The semantic similarity score is then calculated for objects with the same predicate. We make a linear combination of two scores to get the similarity score that is used to determine the depth of given keyword query results. We evaluate our algorithm with other approaches in terms of accuracy and query processing performance. The results of our empirical experiments show that our approach outperforms other existing approaches in terms of efficiency and query processing performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014","2019-06-15 15:23:51","2019-06-15 17:18:17","","264-275","","","146","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A principal issue for clustering is computing the semantic similarity between services. Current approaches use similarity-distance measurement methods such as keyword, information-retrieval or ontology based methods. These approaches have problems that include discovering semantic characteristics, loss of semantic information and a shortage of high-quality ontologies. In this paper, the authors present a method that first adopts ontology learning to generate ontologies via the hidden semantic patterns existing within complex terms. If calculating similarity using the generated ontology fails, it then applies an information-retrieval-based method. Another important issue is identifying the most suitable cluster representative. This paper proposes an approach to identifying the cluster center by combining service similarity with term frequency-inverse document frequency values of service names. Experimental results show that our term-similarity approach outperforms comparable existing approaches. They also demonstrate the positive effects of our cluster-center identification approach.

Our method is based on measuring the semantic similarity of the thematic graph created from a text document and the ontology sub-graphs resulting from the projection of the defined contexts. The domain ontology effectively becomes the classifier, where classification topics are expressed using the defined ontological contexts. In contrast to the traditional supervised categorization methods, the proposed method does not require a training set of documents. More importantly, our approach allows dynamically changing the classification topics without retraining of the classifier. In our experiments, we used the English language Wikipedia converted to an RDF ontology to categorize a corpus of current Web news documents into selection of topics of interest.

An important aspect of the clustering process is calculating the semantic similarity of Web services. Most current clustering approaches are based on similarity-distance measurement, including keyword, ontology and information-retrieval-based methods. Problems with these approaches include a shortage of high quality ontologies and a loss of semantic information. In addition, there has been little fine-grained improvement in existing approaches to service clustering. In this paper, we present a new approach to grouping Web services into functionally similar clusters by mining Web service documents and generating an ontology via hidden semantic patterns present within the complex terms used in service features to measure similarity. If calculating the similarity using the generated ontology fails, the similarity is calculated by using an information-retrieval-based term-similarity method that adopts term-similarity measuring techniques used by thesaurus and search engines. Another important aspect of high performance in clustering is identifying the most suitable cluster center. To improve the utility of clusters, we propose an approach to identifying the cluster center that combines service similarity with the term frequency-inverse document frequency values of service names. Experimental results show that our clustering approach performs better than existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","2013","2019-06-15 15:23:52","2019-06-15 17:19:00","","340-347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, both kinds of service discovery approaches have their limitations in finding out suitable web services for users. Text-based approaches cannot reflect the semantics of the service capability. Ontology-based approaches are likely infeasible and non-scalable since service providers need to spend considerable efforts to annotate the service descriptions.

Semantic similarity measures exploit knowledge sources as the base to perform the estimations. In recent years, ontologies have grown in interest thanks to global initiatives such as the Semantic Web, offering an structured knowledge representation. Thanks to the possibilities that ontologies enable regarding semantic interpretation of terms many ontology-based similarity measures have been developed. According to the principle in which those measures base the similarity assessment and the way in which ontologies are exploited or complemented with other sources several families of measures can be identified. In this paper, we survey and classify most of the ontology-based approaches developed in order to evaluate their advantages and limitations and compare their expected performance both from theoretical and practical points of view. We also present a new ontology-based measure relying on the exploitation of taxonomical features.

Understanding of how humans are able to perform this task is not easy. Semantic similarity denotes computing the similarity between concepts, having the same meaning or related information, which are not necessarily lexically similar. Semantic similarity between concepts plays an important role in Semantic Web, knowledge sharing, Web mining, semantic sense understanding and text summarization. This also is an important problem in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval Researches. These techniques are becoming important components of most of the Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and other intelligent knowledge based systems. Therefore it has received considerable attention in the literature. Ontology has a good hierarchical structure of concepts. In the ontology, semantic information can be realized through the semantic relationship of concepts. Ontology-based semantic similarity techniques can estimate the semantic similarity between two hierarchically expressed concepts in a given ontology or taxonomy. Semantic similarity is usually computed by mapping concepts to ontology and by examining their relationships in it. The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Several algorithmic approaches for computing semantic similarity have been proposed.

Nowadays, reuse techniques proposals include software designs or even software specifications. Therefore, this research focuses on software design, specifically on UML Class Diagrams. A semantic technology has been applied to facilitate the retrieval process for an effective reuse. Objective: This research proposes an ontology-based retrieval technique by semantic similarity in order to support effective retrieval process for UML Class Diagrams. Since UML Class Diagrams are a de facto standard in the design stages of a Software Development Process, a good technique is needed to reuse them, i.e. reusing during the design stage instead of just the coding stages. Method: An application ontology modeled using UML specifications was designed to compare UML Class Diagram element types. To measure their similarity, a survey was conducted amongst UML experts. Query expansion was improved by a domain ontology supporting the retrieval phase. The calculus of minimal distances in ontologies was solved using a shortest path algorithm. Results: The case study shows the domain ontology importance in the UML Class Diagram retrieval process as well as the importance of an element type expansion method, such as an application ontology. A correlation between the query complexity and retrieved elements has been identified, by analyzing results. Finally, a positive Return of Investment (ROI) was estimated using Poulin's Model. Conclusion: Because Software Reuse has not to be limited to the coding stage, approaches to reuse design stage must be developed, i.e. UML Class Diagrams reuse. This approach proposes a technique for UML Class Diagrams retrieval, which is one important step towards reuse.

Because taxonomy-based methods can not deal with continually emerging words, recently Web-based methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Because of the noise and redundancy hidden in the Web data, robustness and accuracy are still challenges. In this paper, we propose a method integrating page counts and snippets returned by Web search engines. Then, the semantic snippets and the number of search results are used to remove noise and redundancy in the Web snippets ('Web-snippet' includes the title, summary, and URL of a Web page returned by a search engine). After that, a method integrating page counts, semantics snippets, and the number of already displayed search results are proposed. The proposed method does not need any human annotated knowledge (e.g., ontologies), and can be applied Web-related tasks (e.g., query suggestion) easily. A correlation coefficient of 0.851 against Rubenstein-Goodenough benchmark dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing Web-based methods by a wide margin.

However, search engines retrieve vast amount of information that is far larger than an individual capability of processing. Also enormous amount of such information are not related to user search query. The semantic web provides a promising approach to enhance the search operation. Ontologies can capture concepts for any topic to enable machines to deal with data semantically. In this paper, a proposed technique called HSWS (Hybrid Semantic Web Search) is used to automatically generate ontology concepts for any topic by extracting semantic relationships between concepts from information sources that represent such topic; the resultant ontology concepts is used to re-rank results returned by a search engine for such topic. A new relevancy measure is proposed to rank retrieved documents. The new relevancy measure depends on the degree of semantic similarity between concepts extracted from web pages resulted from query on a topic and indexed ontology concepts that represents the topic.

We apply semantic similarity metrics in order to detect references to ontology topics not explicitly mentioned in the text. Furthermore, we use information from the revision history in order to assess the level of expertise and examine the collaborative peer-reviewing processes happening in Wiki systems in order to calculate a reputation score for each author, based on the author's contribution lifetime.

In the past, many similarity measures have been proposed, exploiting explicit knowledge-such as the structure of a taxonomy-or implicit knowledge-such as information distribution. In the former case, taxonomies and/or ontologies are used to introduce additional semantics; in the latter case, frequencies of term appearances in a corpus are considered. Classical measures based on those premises suffer from some problems: in the first case, their excessive dependency of the taxonomical/ontological structure; in the second case, the lack of semantics of a pure statistical analysis of occurrences and/or the ambiguity of estimating concept statistical distribution from term appearances. Measures based on Information Content (IC) of taxonomical concepts combine both approaches. However, they heavily depend on a properly pre-tagged and disambiguated corpus according to the ontological entities in order to compute accurate concept appearance probabilities. This limits the applicability of those measures to other ontologies -like specific domain ontologies- and massive corpus -like the Web-. In this paper, several of the presented issues are analyzed. Modifications of classical similarity measures are also proposed. They are based on a contextualized and scalable version of IC computation in the Web by exploiting taxonomical knowledge. The goal is to avoid the measures' dependency on the corpus pre-processing to achieve reliable results and minimize language ambiguity. Our proposals are able to outperform classical approaches when using the Web for estimating concept probabilities. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2010","2019-06-15 15:23:55","2019-06-15 16:43:01","","383-413","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting from the fundamental assumption that similarity of context implies similarity of meaning, relevant Web documents are downloaded via a Web search engine and the contextual information of words of interest is compared (context-based similarity metrics). The proposed algorithms work automatically, do not require any human-annotated knowledge resources, e.g., ontologies, and can be generalized and applied to different languages. Context-based metrics are evaluated both on the Charles-Miller data set and on a medical term data set. It is shown that context-based similarity metrics significantly outperform co-occurrence-based metrics, in terms of correlation with human judgment, for both tasks. In addition, the proposed unsupervised context-based similarity computation algorithms are shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art supervised semantic similarity algorithms that employ language-specific knowledge resources. Specifically, context-based metrics achieve correlation scores of up to 0.88 and 0.74 for the Charles-Miller and medical data sets, respectively.

Several measures have been developed to compare concepts specified in various description logics. In most cases, these measures are either structural or require a populated ontology. Structural measures fail with an increasing expressivity of the used description logic, while several ontologies, e.g., geographic feature type ontologies, are not populated at all. In this paper, we present an approach to reduce inter-concept to inter-instance similarity and thereby avoid the canonization problem of structural measures. The novel approach, called SIM-DLA, reuses existing similarity functions such as co-occurrence or network measures from our previous SIM-DL measure. The required instances for comparison are derived from the completion tree of a slightly modified DL-tableau algorithm as used for satisfiability checking.

Mainly, multiple crawlers can discover semantic instances (i.e., ontology fragments) from annotated resources in a web space, and a centralized meta-crawler can carry out incremental aggregation of the semantic instances sent by the multiple crawlers. To do this, we exploit similarity-based ontology matching algorithm for computing semantic fitness of a population, i.e., summation of all possible semantic similarities between the semantic instances. As a result, we could efficiently obtain the best mapping condition (i.e., maximizing the semantic fitness) of the estimated semantic structures.

The ontologies are used to semantically annotate each peer schema, making explicit the type of information provided by it. A major problem in such a system is that peers cannot easily judge the semantic relativeness of their interests to interests of other peers, as these are expressed by the respective local schemas. Moreover, peers cannot evaluate the semantic relativeness of answers that they receive to their queries. In this paper, we propose a semantic similarity measure for evaluating the semantic relativeness between peer schemas, as well as between queries and their rewritten versions on other peers. The similarity measure is first introduced under the assumption of a shared ontology among the community of peers, and then it is extended, employing ontology matching and translation techniques, to support the comparison of class expressions accross multiple ontologies.

Semantic text similarity was made possible with the availability of resources in the form of semantic lexicon such as the WordNet for English and GermaNet for German. However, for languages such as Malay, text similarity proved to be difficult due to the unavailability of similar resources.

The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Ontology serves as the metadata for defining the information on semantic web. Ontology based semantic information retrieval (semantic retrieval) is becoming more and more important. Many research and industrial works have been made so far on semantic retrieval. Ontology based retrieval improves the performance of search engine and web mining. In semantic retrieval, a great number of accesses to ontologies usually lead the ontology servers to be very low efficient. To address this problem, it is indeed necessary to cache concepts and instances when ontology server is running. Existing caching methods from database community can be used in the ontology cache. However, they are not sufficient for dealing with the problem. In the task of caching in database, usually the most frequently accessed data are cached and the recently less frequently accessed data in the cache are removed from it. Different from that, in ontology base, data are organized as objects and relations between objects. User may request one object, and then request another object according to a relation of that object. He may also possibly request a similar object that has not any relations to the object. Ontology caching should consider more factors and is more difficult. In this paper, ontology caching is formalized as a problem of classification. In this way, ontology caching becomes independent from any specific semantic web application. An approach is proposed by using machine learning methods. When an object (e.g. concept or instance) is requested, we view its similar objects as candidates. A classification model is then used to predict whether each of these candidates should be cached or not. Features in classification models are defined. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for ontology caching. The proposed method has been applied to a research project that is called SWARMS. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","2006","2019-06-15 15:23:57","2019-06-15 17:19:14","","250-262","","","3841 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As RS applications continue to increase in magnitude, major problems include how to discover and make quick and robust use of such data in spatial data infrastructures (SDIs). In this paper, a new RS image discovery method is proposed for discovering observational data based on task, location, and time. This method approaches location and time not only as filters but also as spatial-temporal constraints in the discovery process, and exploits the relationships between tasks and RS data sources under spatial-temporal constraints through case-based reasoning (CBR). In this method, cases are past experiences which comprise task, time, location, and image parameters, describing what images were used to satisfy a particular task, and at what time and place each discovery was made. CBR, given its similarity to assessment and result reasoning models, finds past cases that satisfy a user's query and generates image parameters for specific RS data needed to satisfy that request. A prototype called iGeoportal was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that it performs efficiently when discovering RS images and can be easily integrated into current SDIs through a service-oriented architecture.","2016-01","2019-06-15 15:03:43","2019-06-15 15:28:45","","454-466","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Case-based reasoning (CBR); case-based reasoning approach; Cognition; Geospatial analysis; iGeoportal; image discovery; Metadata; Ontologies; ontology; remote sensing; Remote sensing; remote sensing (RS); Semantics; Sensors; service-oriented architecture; spatial data infrastructures; spatial data structures; spatial reasoning; spatial-temporal constraints; task-driven; task-driven remote sensing image discovery; user query","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ease the process of building ontologies automatically, this manuscript per the authors proposes a new approach which extracts semantic roles of nouns in the sentential structure along with usual concepts and their relationships. The extracted information about different roles, concepts and relationships among the concepts from different documents are then merged to construct an ontology for whole document.

For instance, an educational system based on the semantic web (ESBSW) which represents the content and the knowledge in the form of ontology and counts on intelligent agents that allow machines to understand the web content. In this paper, a new approach for an educational system based on the semantic web is developed. The architecture of the system and the new mechanism for similarity and indexing based on ontology is proposed and elaborated. This paper also compares the performance evaluation of indexing system in the vector space model (VSM) and ontology-based information retrieval models.

Traditional Information Retrieval model commonly used in commercial search engine is based on keyword indexing system and Boolean logic queries. One big drawback of traditional information retrieval is that they typically retrieve information without an explicitly defined domain of interest to the users so that a lot of no relevance information returns to users, which burden the user to pick up useful answer from these no relevance results. In order to tackle this issue, many semantic web information retrieval models have been proposed recently. The main advantage of Semantic Web is to enhance search mechanisms with the use of Ontology's mechanisms. In this paper, we present our approach to personalize web search engine based on ontology. In addition, key techniques are also discussed in our paper. Compared to previous research, our works concentrate on the semantic similarity and the whole process including query submission and information annotation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Especially a context dependent concept mapping is tackled, which needs contextual information from knowledge taxonomy. Context-based semantic similarity differs from the real world similarity in that it requires contextual information to calculate similarity. The notion of semantic coupling is introduced to derive similarity for a taxonomy-based system. The semantic coupling shows the degree of semantic cohesiveness for a group of concepts toward a given context. In order to calculate the semantic coupling effectively, the edge counting method is revisited for measuring basic semantic similarity by considering the weighting attributes from where they affect an edge's strength. The attributes of scaling depth effect, semantic relation type, and virtual connection for the edge counting are considered. Furthermore, how the proposed edge counting method could be well adapted for calculating context-based similarity is showed. Thorough experimental results are provided for both edge counting and context-based similarity. The results of proposed edge counting were encouraging compared with other combined approaches, and the context-based similarity also showed understandable results. The novel contributions of this paper come from two aspects. First, the similarity is increased to the viable level for edge counting. Second, a mechanism is provided to derive a context-based similarity in taxonomy-based system, which has emerged as a hot issue in the literature such as Semantic Web, MDR, and other ontology-mapping environments.","2005-05","2019-06-15 15:40:47","2019-06-15 15:40:47","","296-308","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Semantic Web calls for the use of ontologies for many domains. Although meaningful and important, ontology development presents great challenges to the developers especially in terms of conceptual dynamics.. This paper is based on a study that attempts to provide an alternative to ontology lookup for Semantic information retrieval. However, the focus of the paper is on a method proposed to extract adjacency matrix from concepts obtained from the theory of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) using two consecutive algorithms called the Relatedness Algorithm and Adjacency Matrix Algorithm. Consequently, the adjacency matrices obtained could be used in a similarity measure process based on graph theory. The proposed method offers an alternative to specific domain ontology look-up where results from the measure can further be used in concept-based IR process.","2017","2019-06-15 15:46:38","2019-06-28 15:02:23","","56:1–56:6","","","","","","","ICC '17","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cambridge, United Kingdom","","","","adjacency matrix; formal concept analysis; graph theory; information retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, knowledge in the world continuously evolves, and ontologies are largely incomplete for what concerns low-frequency data, belonging to the so-called long tail. Socially produced content is an excellent source for discovering emerging knowledge: it is huge, and immediately reflects the relevant changes which hide emerging entities. Thus, we propose a method for discovering emerging entities by extracting them from social content. Once instrumented by experts through very simple initialization, the method is capable of finding emerging entities; we use a purely syntactic method as a baseline, and we propose several semantics-based variants. The method uses seeds, i.e. prototypes of emerging entities provided by experts, for generating candidates; then, it associates candidates to feature vectors, built by using terms occurring in their social content, and then ranks the candidates by using their distance from the centroid of seeds, returning the top candidates as result. The method can be continuously or periodically iterated, using the results as new seeds. We validate our method by applying it to a set of diverse domain-specific application scenarios, spanning fashion, literature, and exhibitions.","2017","2019-06-15 15:46:38","2019-06-28 15:02:06","","795–804","","","","","","","WWW '17","","","","International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","Republic and Canton of Geneva, Switzerland","","","","","","","","event-place: Perth, Australia","","","","big data; content analysis; emerging knowledge; entity typing; evolving knowledge; knowledge extraction; online communities; social media analysis; web data mining; web science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we focus on a particular class of images that convey semantic meaning beyond the visual appearance, and whose search presents particular challenges. A prominent example is Memes, an emerging popular type of captioned pictures, which we will use in this demo to demonstrate our solution. Unlike in conventional image-search, visually similar Memes may reflect different concepts. The intent is sometimes captured by user annotations, but these too are often incomplete and ambiguous. Thus, a deeper analysis of the semantic relations among Memes is required for an accurate search. To address this problem, we present SimMeme, a semantic aware search engine for Memes. SimMeme uses a generic graph-based data model that aligns all the information available about the Memes with a semantic ontology. A novel similarity measure that interweaves common image, textual, structural and semantic similarities into one holistic measure is employed to effectively answer user queries. We will demonstrate the operation of SimMeme over a large repository of real-life annotated Memes which we have constructed by web crawling and crowd annotations, allowing users to appreciate the quality of the search results as well as the execution efficiency.","2017","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:44:54","2455–2458","","","","","","SimMeme","CIKM '17","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","/home/luana/Zotero/storage/JBT52FXK/Ekron et al. - 2017 - SimMeme Semantic-Based Meme Search.pdf","","","image-search; information-network; semantic; similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, using shared ontologies has been crucial to gain interoperability, and to be able to integrate and exploit third party datasets. However, using the same ontology does not suffice to successfully query or integrate external data within your own dataset: the actual usage of the vocabulary (e.g., which concepts have instances, which properties are actually populated and how, etc.) is crucial for these tasks. Beingable to compare different RDF graphs at the actual usage level would indeed help in such situations. Unfortunately, the complexity of graph comparison is an obstacle to the scalability of many approaches. In this article, we present our structural similarity measure, designed to compare structural similarity of low-level data between two different RDF graphs according to the patterns they share. To obtain such patterns, we leverage a data mining method (KRIMP) which allows to extract the most descriptive patterns appearing in a transactional database. We adapt this method to the particularities of RDF data, proposing two different conversions for an RDF graph.

Considering the users' explanations of how pairs of documents are related, the aim is to identify concepts in a KB graph that express the same notion of document relatedness. Our algorithm generates paths through the KB graph that originate from the terms in two documents. KB concepts where these paths intersect capture the semantic relatedness of the two starting terms and therefore the two documents. We consider how such intersecting concepts relate to the concepts in the users' explanations. The higher the users' concepts appear in the ranked list of intersecting concepts, the better the method in capturing the users' notion of document relatedness.

We argue that the explicit management of ontological knowledge, and of the meaning of concepts (by integrating linguistic and encyclopaedic knowledge in the system ontology), can improve the analysis of search queries, because it enables a flexible identification of the topics the user is searching for, regardless of the adopted vocabulary. This paper proposes an information retrieval support model based on semantic concept identification. Starting from the recognition of the ontology concepts that the search query refers to, this model exploits the qualifiers specified in the query to select information items on the basis of possibly fine-grained features. Moreover, it supports query expansion and reformulation by suggesting the exploration of semantically similar concepts, as well as of concepts related to those referred in the query through thematic relations.

Although this problem is well-studied in news and social media, this problem has not received much attention in the life science domain. One outcome of tackling the EL problem in the life sciences domain is to enable scientists to build computational models of biological processes with more efficiency. However, simply applying a news-trained entity linker produces inadequate results. Since existing supervised approaches require a large amount of manually-labeled training data, which is currently unavailable for the life science domain, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured full texts of biomedical literature to 300 ontologies. The approach leverages the rich semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation and entity ranking. Without using any manual annotation, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EL method (9% absolute gain in linking accuracy). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art supervised EL method requires 15,000 manually annotated entity mentions for training. These promising results establish a benchmark for the EL task in the life science domain1. We also provide in depth analysis and discussion on both challenges and opportunities on automatic knowledge enrichment for scientific literature. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to address the EL problem in a new domain. We show that our unsupervised approach is able to outperform a current state-of-the-art supervised approach that has been trained with a large amount of manually labeled data. Life science presents an underrepresented domain for applying EL techniques. By providing a small benchmark data set and identifying opportunities, we hope to stimulate discussions across natural language processing and bioinformatics and motivate others to develop techniques for this largely untapped domain.","2014","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:35","3–4","","","","","","","DTMBIO '14","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Shanghai, China","","/home/luana/Zotero/storage/UCP3PEEJ/Zheng et al. - 2014 - Entity Linking for Biomedical Literature.pdf","","","biomedical literature; bological ontologies; entity linking; semantic web; signal transduction; text mining; wikification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such enrichment of existing hierarchical knowledge sources with new information to better model the ""changing world"" presents two-fold challenges: (1) Detection of previously unknown entities or concepts, and (2) Insertion of the new concepts into the knowledge structure, respecting the semantic integrity of the created relationships. To this end we propose a novel framework, ETF, to enrich large-scale, generic taxonomies with new concepts from resources such as news and research publications. Our approach learns a high-dimensional embedding for the existing concepts of the taxonomy, as well as for the new concepts. During the insertion of a new concept, this embedding is used to identify semantically similar neighborhoods within the existing taxonomy. The potential parent-child relationships linking the new concepts to the existing ones are then predicted using a set of semantic and graph features. Extensive evaluation of ETF on large, real-world taxonomies of Wikipedia and WordNet showcase more than 5% F1-score improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

To date, methods and techniques to extract useful and relevant information from online repositories of research data have largely been based on static full text indexing which entails a 'produce once and use forever' kind of strategy. That strategy is fast becoming insufficient due to increasing data volume, concept obsolescence, and complexity and heterogeneity of content types in web repositories. We propose that by automatic semantic annotation of content in web repositories (using Linked Open Data or LoD sources) without using domain-specific ontologies, we can sustain the performance of searching by retrieving highly relevant search results. Secondly, we claim that by expert crowd-annotation of content on top of automatic semantic annotation, we can enrich the semantic index over time to augment the contextual value of content in web repositories so that they remain findable despite changes in language, terminology and scientific concepts. We deployed a custom-built annotation, indexing and searching environment in a web repository website that has been used by expert annotators to annotate webpages using free text and vocabulary terms. We present our findings based on the annotation and tagging data on top of LoD-based annotations and the overall modus operandi.

This research is motivated by the lacks of previous built QAS that caused by a keyword-based retrieval. Instead of keeping the retrieval method, we shifted to a semantic approach where the retrieval process is done by using a semantic similarity measurement. In doing so, we built an ontology of ITQ to get the concepts as well as verses where they appear in. We applied three factoid question types on the QAS that including Who, Where, and When. Furthermore, a weighted vector for each concept that belongs to respective expected answering type (also called as named entity group) i.e. Person, Location, and Time is generated in order to feed semantic interpreter on user question. From 222 concepts defined from the ontology, we clustered them into 77, 24, and 6 concepts for Person, Location, and Time respectively. Since we found there are some characteristics of texts in ITQ, we developed our own modules to deal with including generate the inverted index and named entity recognition. Answer extraction is conducted by applying some features extraction in order to score the answer candidates. Evaluation of the system is designed by providing two data set of question and answer where the first one is purposed to measure the effectiveness of semantic approach comparing with keyword-based retrieval and the last one aims to know system performance in regard the appearance of concepts in ITQ.","2016","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:46","504–507","","","","","","","iiWAS '16","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","/home/luana/Zotero/storage/QN5NV7MS/Putra et al. - 2016 - A Semantic-based Question Answering System for Ind.pdf","","","indonesian translation of Quran; question answering system; semantic approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a novel solution to handling multifaceted seeds by combining existing user-generated ontologies with a novel word-similarity metric based on skip-grams. By blending the two resources we are able to produce sparse word ego-networks that are centered on the seed terms and are able to capture semantic equivalence among words. We demonstrate that the resulting networks possess internally-coherent clusters, which can be exploited to provide non-overlapping expansions, in order to reflect different semantic classes of the seeds. Empirical evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines shows that our solution, EgoSet, is able to not only capture multiple facets in the input query, but also generate expansions for each facet with higher precision.","2016","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:49","645–654","","","","","","EgoSet","WSDM '16","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: San Francisco, California, USA","","/home/luana/Zotero/storage/K7IADKS9/Rong et al. - 2016 - EgoSet Exploiting Word Ego-networks and User-gene.pdf","","","entity set expansion; information extraction; web mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose methods to generate a sample of representative microposts by discovering tweets that are likely to refer to new entities. Our approach is able to significantly speed-up the semantic analysis process by discarding retweets, tweets without pre-identifiable entities, as well similar and redundant tweets, while retaining information content. We apply the approach on a corpus of 1:4 billion microposts, using the IE services of AlchemyAPI, Calais, and Zemanta to identify more than 700,000 unique entities. For the evaluation we compare runtime and number of entities extracted based on the full and the downscaled version of a micropost set. We are able to demonstrate that for datasets of more than 10 million tweets we can achieve a reduction in size of more than 80% while maintaining up to 60% coverage on unique entities cumulatively discovered by the three IE tools. We publish the resulting Twitter metadata as Linked Data using SIOC and an extension of the NERD core ontology.","2014","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","2019-06-15 17:45:53","5–12","","","","","","","SEM '14","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Leipzig, Germany","","/home/luana/Zotero/storage/YLNE8RYJ/Feyisetan et al. - 2014 - Quick-and-clean Extraction of Linked Data Entities.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
